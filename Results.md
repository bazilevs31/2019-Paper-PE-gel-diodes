Results:



1) Show the plot of the BVP vs MD profile of the simulation

introduce different parts of the plot

study plan:

1. The qualitative character of the plot, peaks, width
   1. Can we explain it?
   2. Why are they different?
   3. the deliverable: **Can we introduce an electric chain model with capacitors o the system?**

2. The quantitative charcter of the plot comparing the PB vs BVP

   1. MD vs PB profile plots
   2. The dEpeak vs lb at different electric fields, with or without the ionization
   3. MD vs PB condensation plots

   Study plan here is to conder 4 scenarios: weak and strong coupling (small or large Bjerrum lengths) as well as weak or strong electric fields

   for all of the 4 scenarios we want to say what type of model is applicable: Naive PB, Modified PB with the manning criterion, modified PB with the MD informed parameters.
