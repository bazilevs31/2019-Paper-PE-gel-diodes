  abstract = {The salt dependent radius of gyration of a polyelectrolyte in aqueous solution is calculated in an environment where the polyelectrolyte is surrounded by a permeable membrane that exchanges only solvent particles with the bulk. We obtain additionally the scaling exponent of the gyration radius as a function of the polymerization degree, and find that the polyelectrolyte retains a stretched conformation during the condensation and re-expansion process, indicating that these effects are of an electrostatic nature. The solvent quality is also shown to affect the polyelectrolyte conformation, especially for the poor solvent case. These results are obtained using a hybridized Monte Carlo technique with the coarse-grained, dissipative particle dynamics method with fluctuating number of solvent particles. The full range of the electrostatic interactions is included in the simulations, using the Ewald sum method, and the counterions and solvent molecules are included explicitly. In the complex systems mentioned above, the electrostatic interactions and the solvent quality play a key role in understanding phenomena that do not occur in uncharged systems. Our results are compared and validated with the behavior of some biomolecules under similar environments.},

Swelling behavior, density profiles, and effective charges are all calculated in a self-consistent way. Special attention is given to the effects of salinity on these quantities. It is found that the equilibrium microgel size is strongly influenced by the amount of added salt. Increasing the salt concentration leads to a considerable reduction of the microgel volume, which therefore releases its internal material -- solvent molecules and dissociated ions -- into the solution. Finally, the question of charge renormalization of ionic microgels in the context of the cell model is briefly addressed.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ‚â§ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

The majority of applications of polymeric materials is based on their excellent mechanical properties, which arise from the long-chain nature of the constituents. Microscopically, this means that polymeric materials are able to respond to external forces in a broad frequency range, i.e., with a broad range of relaxation processes. Computer simulation methods are ideally suited to help to understand these processes and the structural properties that lead to them and to further our ability to predict materials properties and behavior. However, the broad range of timescales and underlying structure prohibits any one single simulation method from capturing all of these processes. This manuscript provides an overview of some of the more popular computational models and methods used today in the field of molecular and mesoscale simulation of polymeric materials, ranging from molecular models and methods that treat electronic degrees of freedom to mesoscopic field theoretic methods.},

  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. We use hybrid molecular dynamics/Monte Carlo simulations and coarse-grained polymer models to study the swelling of polyelectrolyte gels in salt solutions. Besides existing industrial applications, such gels have been recently proposed as a promising agent for water desalination. We employ the semi-grand canonical ensemble to investigate partitioning of the salt between the bulk solution and the gel and the salt-induced deswelling of the gels under free swelling equilibrium and under compression. We compare our findings to the analytic model of Katchalsky and Michaeli which explicitly accounts for electrostatic effects. The partitioning of small ions predicted by the model well captures the deviations from the simple Donnan approximation observed in the simulation data. In contrast, the original model highly overestimates the gel swelling, predicting even chain stretching beyond contour length. With a modified model, where we replace the Gaussian elasticity with the Langevin function for finite extensibility, we obtain nearly quantitative agreement between theory and simulations both for the swelling ratio and for the partitioning of salt, across the whole range of studied gel parameters and salt concentrations. The modified model thus provides a very good description of swelling of polyelectrolyte gels in salt solutions and can be used for theoretical predictions of water desalination using hydrogels. These predictions are much less computationally demanding than the simulations which we used to validate the model.},

  abstract = {Poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone-co-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (P(VP-co-HEMA)) hydrogel system with a composition of VP:HEMA = 37:13 was studied using molecular dynamics simulations in order to investigate the effect of the water content on the equilibrium structures and the mechanical properties. The degree of randomness of the monomer sequence for the random and the blocky copolymers, were 1.170 and 0.104, respectively, and the degree of polymerization was fixed at 50. The equilibrated density of the hydrogel was found to be larger for the random sequence than for the blocky sequence at low water contents ({\textless}40 wt{\%}), but this density difference decreased with increasing water content. The pair correlation function analysis shows that VP is more hydrophilic than HEMA and that the random sequence hydrogel is solvated more than the blocky sequence hydrogel at low water content, which disappears with increasing water content. Correspondingly, the water structure is more disrupted by the random sequence hydrogel at low water content but eventually develops the expected bulk water-like structure with increasing water content. From mechanical deformation simulations, stress-strain analysis showed that the VP is found to relax more efficiently, especially in the blocky sequence, so that the blocky sequence hydrogel shows less stress levels compared to the random sequence hydrogel. As the water content increases, the stress level becomes identical for both sequences. The elastic moduli of the hydrogels calculated from the constant strain energy minimization show the same trend with the stress-strain analysis. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, correctly using them to calculate physical properties of interest is subtle and cannot be uncoupled from the route by which they were derived. Furthermore, there is usually no unique way to coarse-grain to an effective pair potential. Even for simple systems like liquid argon. the pair potential that correctly reproduces the pair structure will not generate the right virial pressure. Ignoring these issues in naive applications of density dependent pair potentials can lead to an apparent dependence of thermodynamic properties on the ensemble within which they are calculated. as well as other inconsistencies. These concepts are illustrated by several pedagogical examples. including effective pair potentials for systems with many-body interactions, and the mapping of charged (Debye-Huckel) and uncharged (Asakura-Oosawa) two-component systems onto effective one-component ones.

For a LJ fluid in a nanochannel with hydrophilic surfaces, the velocity profiles have the traditional parabolic shape. The no-slip boundary condition may break down when the driving force exceeds a critical value that overcomes the interfacial resistance. In such a case, the MD results show a pattern of an adsorbing layer sliding along the solid wall. For a LJ fluid in a nanochannel with hydrophobic interfaces, the results show that a gap exists between the liquid and the surface, resulting in almost frictionless resistance; the velocity shows a plug flow profile and the slip length is not constant but depends on the driving force. Furthermore, it is found that the non-uniform temperature and pressure profiles near the solid walls are owing to the effect of interface wettability. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The swelling of regular, tightly meshed model networks is investigated by a molecular-dynamics-Monte Carlo hybrid technique. The chemical equilibrium between two simulation boxes representing the gel phase and a solvent bath, respectively, is obtained by subjecting the Lennard-Jones particles of a binary mixture, serving as explicit solvent, to the particle transfer step of Gibbs ensemble-Monte Carlo. The swelling behavior, especially preferential absorption of a single component, whose dependence on temperature, pressure, and fluid composition is studied, also depends significantly on the size of the central simulation cell. These finite-size effects correlate well with those exhibited by the density of solvent-free (dry) networks. A theoretical expression, whose derivation is based on network elasticity (of dry networks) yields finite-size scaling behavior in good accord with simulation results for both dry networks and gels in contact with solvent baths. This expression can be used to extrapolate the swelling behavior of simulated finite systems to infinite system size.},

  abstract = {In this work, coarse-grained simulations of two charged thermo-shrinking nanogels (with degrees of ionization of 0.125 and 0.250) in the presence of 1:1 and 3:1 electrolytes have been explicitly performed through the bead-spring model of polyelectrolyte. In a first set of simulations, salt concentrations for 1:1 and 3:1 electrolytes ranged from 1 to 100 mM and from 0.167 to 16.7 mM, respectively, whereas temperature remained fixed at a value for which hydrophobic forces were negligible in our case (288 K). The sizes of swollen nanogels are smaller when trivalent cations are present, but they do not change significantly in the range of concentrations of 3:1 electrolyte studied here. It should be also stressed that trivalent cations neutralize the nanogel charge more efficiently. According to these results the electrostatic repulsion plays an important role. In a second set of simulations, the temperature varied from 288 to 333 K to study the effect of salt on the thermal response when hydrophobic forces are not negligible. For the nanogels with the lowest degree of ionization, the behavior of the radius with increasing the temperature can be described by a sigmoid function, which shifts towards lower temperatures in the presence of salt. This shift is more clearly observed for trivalent cations, even at low concentrations. For the nanogels with the highest degree of ionization, the effect of additional electrolyte is also noticeable. In this case, hydrophobic forces are not the only responsible for their shrinkage in the presence of trivalent cations. The surface electrostatic potential and the concentration of salt cations inside the nanogel have been computed from simulations and a modified Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) cell model. The thermosensitivity in size have certain influence on the sensitivity of these properties to temperature changes. The rich behavior of the surface electrostatic potential and the uptake of salt cations are successfully predicted by the modified PB cell model proposed (at least qualitatively). Particularly, the model is able to predict how the retention of salt cations depends on their charge and the ionic valence when nanogels shrink.},

As far as we know, such simulations have not been applied to temperature-sensitive charged nanogels yet. Monovalent and divalent counterions have been considered. Charge profiles inside and outside the nanogel have been computed from simulations, revealing an attractive finding for the use of these nanoparticles as potential drug carriers: when charged nanogels collapse, they can sometimes form a hollow sphere, with the charged beads concentrated on the inner and outer surfaces, and some counterions enclosed in the inner space. Simulations also show that the surface electrostatic potential increases when nanogels shrink upon heating. However, the fraction of counterions inside these soft nanoparticles slightly varies with temperature. Charge profiles were also calculated using a Poisson-Boltzmann cell model. Its predictions about the charge profile outside the nanogel, the fraction of counterions inside and the surface electrostatic potential are in fair agreement with simulation data. This suggests that this model provides valuable information about the electric double layer of thermo-responsive nanogels.},

  abstract = {The segmental order of monomodal and bimodal polymer networks is investigated by proton multiple-quantum NMR spectroscopy as applied to poly(dimethylsiloxane) model systems and by Monte Carlo simulations using the bond fluctuation model. The multiple-quantum method is sensitive to chain order parameter distributions and therefore probes heterogeneities in the extent of fast motional averaging of individual network strands subject to topological constraints. These data are in qualitative agreement with the simulations. We find a broadening of the chain order parameter distribution upon swelling accompanied by a nonaffine change of this distribution, indicating a heterogeneous swelling process. Comparing the simulated tensor order parameter with the autocorrelation function of segments, we observe major deviations in the swollen state but also for the long-chain fraction of the dry, bimodal network. These effects are attributed to the fluctuation dependence of the tensor order parameter which comprises information about both orientational order as well as fluctuation properties of fast segment reorientation processes. In general, our results indicate that segmental order is not simply related to the cross-link density. Fluctuations on larger scales such as reorientation of chain clusters, dynamical correlations between segments in the entangled state, and heterogeneities in the segmental fluctuations have an essential influence on the tensorial order. The spatial length scale of the heterogeneities is also investigated by self-diffusion measurements of the solvent molecules.},

An increase in the gel volume was observed for increasing charge density, decreasing cross-linking density, and increasing chain stiffness. The exchange of the monovalent counterions for divalent counterions reduced the equilibrium volume of the gel substantially.

  abstract = {Using the bond-fluctuation model, we study bimodal networks obtained from end-linking long (100 repeat units) and short (repeat units) chains in the melt state. The short chains are dilute among the long chains but provide the majority of chain ends. We discuss the necessary conditions under under which the end-linking process results in the formation of clusters of short chains within the network structure. In our simulations, the onset of this behavior can he observed. On the other hand, the tendency of short chains to form loops is much increased. In the melt state, these loops are likely to form trapped- entanglement long chains, thus yielding a very particular topological structure. We swell the cross-linked systems in an athermal solvent close to equilibrium. The swelling process can a subdivided into twos steps. fast intrusion of solvent into the network provides a large part of the swelling ratio. This is followed by a slow relaxation process, which allows for cooperative reorganization of the network. Our simulations show that swelling of individual strands is highly subaffine. Unfolding of the network structure is necessary in order to provide the global swelling ratio. We systematically analyze the dependency of nonaffine deformation processes as a function of the size of connected substructures. As a result, we conclude that clusters comprising hundreds of strands are necessary to provide affine behavior. These findings can be related to the topological structure formed by the cross- linking process. In particular, we define a folding length which corresponds to the minimal topological distance along the network structure which connect two neighboring monomers in space. The distribution of folding lengths shows a broad peak in the range of the observed nonaffine swelling behavior. Our results show that entanglement constraints do not suppress unfolding of the network structure and challenge simplified theoretical models.},

  abstract = {The volumetric properties of highly-charged defect-free polyelectrolyte networks with tetrafunctional crosslinks are studied through molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble. The network backbone monomers, which are monovalent, and the counterions, which are mono-, di-, or trivalent, are modeled explicitly in the simulations, but the solvent is treated implicitly as a dielectric medium of good solvation quality. The osmotic pressure of the network-solvent system is found to depend greatly on the strength of electrostatic interactions. Discontinuous volume phase transitions are observed when the electrostatic interactions are strong, and the onset of these transitions shifts to higher solvent dielectricity as the counterion valency increases. The roles of the various virial contributions to the osmotic pressure are examined. The network elasticity entropy is found to behave nearly classically. As the network contracts and collapses with increasing strength of electrostatic interactions, the loss of counterion entropy leads to increased counterion osmotic pressure contributions via two mechanisms. The reduction in available configurational space increases the counterion translational entropy contribution to the ideal part of the osmotic pressure, and the greater number of counterion-monomer contacts formed due to counterion condensation and confinement increases the counterion excluded-volume entropy contribution to the excess part of the osmotic pressure. These observations contrast the decrease in the single ideal-gas-like counterion translational entropy contribution to the osmotic pressure predicted by the counterion condensation-charge renormalization theory. An accompanying decrease in the total electrostatic energy balances the loss of counterion excluded-volume entropy as the polyelectrolyte networks collapse in low-dielectric solvents. This interplay between the electrostatic energy and the counterion excluded-volume entropy appears to be responsible for the discontinuous volume phase transitions that are observed in polyelectrolyte networks. The structure of the polyelectrolyte network is also found to be affine in the swollen state, with constituent chains nearly fully extended, and nonaffine in the collapsed state, with the chains adopting a Gaussian conformation.},

  abstract = {Computer simulation is used to study tracer or chain diffusion in polyelectrolyte gels. Owing to the limitation of present computer power, a mesoscopic approach is adopted to handle long time dynamics in this thesis. Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulation is mainly employed to study the self-diffusion of tracer particles and polymer chain in a cross-linked gel network based on a coarse-grained bead-spring lattice model with a truncated Lennard-Jones potential representing the excluded volume effect and a screened electrostatic interaction accounting for charge effect. Several effects are investigated including the network porosity, flexibility, degree of cross-linking (for tracer particle diffusion only), and electrostatic interaction. In addition, Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) method is implemented to examine hydrodynamic interaction for tracer diffusion in gel network that is ignored by BD simulation. For tracer particle diffusion, the long-time diffusivity of tracer particle is studied in both uncharged and charged system. It is interesting to find that for charged system the diffusion is further hindered by the electrostatic interaction, regardless of whether the tracer particle and the network are oppositely or similarly charged. However, there exists a difference in the hindrance mechanism between the two cases. For the polymer chain diffusion, the conformation and dynamic properties of polymer chains are examined. For uncharged system, a decrease in diffusivity of chain is observed with the decrease of the porosity of the network. The difference in diffusion behavior of an oppositely and similarly charged chain in gel network is discussed for varied charge amount or Debye length. The static properties of the chain are used to explain the difference between the two cases, such as the average bond angle, the mean-square end-to-end distance, the mean-square radius of gyration, and the three average eigenvalues of the moment of inertia tensor. Finally, the applicability of the DPD method to study the hydrodynamic interaction for the tracer diffusion in gel network is demonstrated, and the advantages or disadvantages of the DPD and BD method are also addressed. These computer simulation results based on the simplified coarse-grained model shed light on the diffusion behaviour of a tracer particle or chain at mesoscopic level. The unusual behaviour of tracer or chain caused by the attractive electrostatic force is intriguing, which can be explained by electrostatic entrapment effect. This effect is dependent on the charge, double layer thickness, and porosity.},

@article{Faulon2001,
  abstract = {A novel computational technique to generate close-to-equilibrium crosslinked polymeric systems is proposed. Compared to the current state-of-the-art equilibration methods, the new technique appears to be faster by several orders ofmagnitude. Themain advantage of the technique is that one can circumvent the bottlenecks in configuration space that inhibit relaxation in molecular dynamics orMonte Carlo simulations. The problemof polymer equilibration described by continuous equations in molecular dynamics is reduced to a discrete representationwhere solutions are approximated by simple algorithms. In the current study, a series of coarse-grained, united-atom, and fully atomistic crosslinked networks has been generated. Network statistics and topology, X-ray scattering intensities, and elastic properties are tested vs. experimental results and similarmodels generated usingmolecular dynamics andMonte Carlo simulations. The results demonstrate the efficiency of this new method for generating large realistic polymeric systems up to 1.4Matoms.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations enable the description of ma- terial properties and processes with atomistic detail by numerically solv- ing the time evolution of every atom in the system. We introduce Poly- merModeler, a general-purpose, online simulation tool to build atomistic structures of amorphous polymers and perform MD simulations on the re- sulting configurations to predict their thermo-mechanical properties. Poly- merModeler is available, free of charge, at nanoHUB.org via an interactive web interface, and the actual simulations are performed in the cloud us- ing nanoHUB.org resources. Starting from the specification of one or more monomers PolymerModeler builds the polymer chains into a simulation cell with periodic boundary conditions at the desired density. Monomers are added sequentially using the continuous configuration bias direct Monte Carlo method, and copolymers can be created describing the desired se- quence of monomers. PolymerModeler also enables users to perform MD simulations on the structures created by the builder using the Dreiding force field and Gasteiger partial atomic charges. We describe the force field im- plementation and the various options for the MD simulations that use the LAMMPS simulator. PolymerModeler MD simulations for a PMMA sam- ple show good structural agreement with experiments and are in good agree- ment with simulations obtained with commercial software.},

  abstract = {We use molecular dynamics (MD) with a procedure to describe chemical reactions to predict the atomic structure and properties of the thermosetting polymer epoxy EPON-862 and curing agent DETDA. The DREIDING force field is employed with environment-dependent atomic charges obtained self consistently during the dynamics. We propose a computationally efficient method to describe charge evolution based on the observation that atomic charges evolve significantly only during chemical reactions and in a repeatable manner. Two chemistry models with different relative rates for primary and secondary amine reactions are used to mimic the curing process in two extreme cases of processing conditions. The simulations show that differences in chemical reaction rates affect properties for intermediate conversion degrees (???40-70{\%}) but not for the higher conversion rates of interest in most applications. We also find that performing the polymerization at high temperatures leads to networks with lower internal strain energy due to increased molecular mobility. The predicted density, coefficient of thermal expansion, glass transition temperature and elastic constants of the resulting polymers are in excellent agreement with experiments. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Phase transformation enthalpies are determined using the recently developed measure-ment technique Thin-Film Calorimetry (TFC), which is based on piezoelectric resonators vibrat-ing in thickness shear mode. They are applicable up to at least 1000 ¬∞C. To the best of our knowledge, no comparable TFC systems for such high temperatures exist. The experimental part is divided into two subsections. The first is addressed to a thermo-dynamic investigation on piezoelectric langasite crystals (LGS, La3Ga5SiO14) which are the key component of the TFC system. The specific heat capacity is measured on LGS crystals of three different manufacturers. It ranges from about 0.45 J g-1 K-1 at 40 ¬∞C to about 0.60 J g-1 K-1 at 1000 ¬∞C. Thereby, deviations of up to 5 {\%} between the different crystals are detected. Thermal diffusivity data for Y-cut LGS crystals are determined as well. Here, a constant decrease with temperature is detected ranging from 0.48 mm2 s-1 at room temperature to 0.38 mm2 s-1 at 700 ¬∞C. The second part presents thin-film calorimetric investigation on thin films of the family Li-Ni-Mn-Co-Al-Oxide (NMC/NMCA). These cathode materials are investigated and compared when annealed in ambient air or 0.5 {\%} H2/Ar up to 860 ¬∞C. Three stoichiometries are chosen: Li(Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3)O2, Li(Ni0.6Mn0.2Co0.2)O2, and Li(Ni0.6Mn0.2Co0.15Al0.05)O2. The samples show three or four phase transformations. In air, the samples crystallize in the range of 250-350 ¬∞C. In 0.5 {\%} H2/Ar, the transformations occur at higher temperatures. Especially in air, stoichiometric NMC crystallizes at lower temperatures compared to Ni-rich compositions. Addi-tional doping with Al enhances the thermal stability which shifts all phase transformations to higher temperatures in both atmospheres.},

@article{Escobedo1999,
  abstract = {Polymer gels are commonly used in industrial, analytical, and domestic applications; their uses are likely to continue expanding as gels with novel chemical and structural characteristics are developed. These applications often rely on the precise control of the adsorption behavior of a gel. Development of useful gels, however, has been hampered by a lack of molecular-level understanding of the physics underlying phase transitions in such materials. In this report, we review recent molecular simulation work related to the study of fundamental aspects of network elasticity and of phase transitions in polymeric gels. In particular, simulations of simplied (coarse-grained) molecular models are described which provide insights into the general behavior of gels, as opposed to studies concerned with the properties of specic materials. Method- ological aspects unique to the simulation of di!erent properties of polymeric gels are emphasized. We also pay special attention to the role of entropic factors (such as network topology, backbone sti!ness, chain length asymmetry), over that of energetic interactions (such as hydrofobic interactions or ionic forces) on the onset and characteristics of phase transitions in gels. In spite of the important advances made over the last years in methodology and computer hardware, many challenges remain if phase transitions for more realistic gel models are to be simulated.},

The volume phase transition behavior of these colloids was investigated by means of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) covering the different length scales of interest. Both methods provide the temperature of the volume phase transition in good agreement. The volume change as followed by DLS is described using the Flory-Rehner theory, leading to the determination of the spinodal temperature. Furthermore, the network correlation length , which is available from appropriate fits of the measured SANS profiles, was used to study the critical behavior in terms of scaling laws. The results from DLS and SANS show a strong cross-linker density dependence.
